# Lab02--Unit-Tests---Documentation

# What is it?
Write unit tests in a new project using the XUnit library. Test the functionality for the above application. Here are the testing requirements:

Test every method/action (that does not require user input); there should be a passing valid input, and a passing invalid input.
Have at least 2 tests for every non-void method.
A failing test, is not a valid test - even if the failure is expected.
